Call Centre Analysis Dashboard Using Power Bi 
Project Overview:
This project analyzes call center performance metrics such as call answer rates, resolution rates, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction. The insights help in identifying key areas for improvement and optimizing operations.

âœ… Analyzed 81% Answered Calls and 72.9% Resolved Calls
âœ… Evaluated Agent Performance based on speed & satisfaction scores,also evaluated the topic wise analysis
âœ… Identified improvement areas in response time & resolution rate
âœ… Visualized data using Power BI

ðŸ›  Technology Stack:
Power BI

ðŸ”‘ Key Insights:
Answered Calls Rate:
81.08% of calls were answered, while 18.92% were missed.
Suggests a fairly good response rate, but efforts can be made to reduce missed calls further.

Resolved Calls Rate:
72.92% of calls were resolved successfully, leaving 27.08% unresolved.
Indicates room for improvement in issue resolution efficiency.

Average Speed of Answer:
Calls are answered in an average of 67.52 seconds.
Can be optimized further to enhance customer satisfaction.

Customer Satisfaction Score:
The average satisfaction rating is 3.40 (on a scale of 0 to 6.81).
This suggests a need for better issue resolution, improved agent communication, or reduced wait times.

Monthly Call Volume:
Call volumes remain consistent across January, February, and March, with approximately 1,500â€“1,800 calls per month.
Seasonal patterns should be analyzed to plan staffing levels accordingly.

Agent Performance Analysis:
Top Agents (Based on Calls Resolved & Satisfaction Scores):
Dan (67.28 sec, 3.45 satisfaction, 471 resolved calls) and Martha (69.49 sec, 3.47 satisfaction, 461 resolved calls) stand out.

Agents with Higher Speed but Lower Satisfaction:
Joe (70.99 sec, 3.33 satisfaction, 436 resolved calls) might need quality improvement training.

Efficiency Leaders:
Jim (66.34 sec, 3.39 satisfaction, 485 resolved calls) has the best speed-to-resolution ratio.

ðŸ“¢ Recommendations:
âœ… Reduce Call Answer Time: Implement better call routing and prioritization strategies.
âœ… Improve Call Resolution Rate: Conduct targeted training for agents handling unresolved calls.
âœ… Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Focus on soft skills training, issue resolution tactics, and reduced wait times.
âœ… Optimize Staffing Based on Peak Hours: Analyze call trends to ensure optimal agent availability.

ðŸš€ Conclusion:
The call center is performing well in terms of answered calls but has opportunities for improvement in resolution rates, customer satisfaction, and speed of answer. By refining agent performance and operational efficiency, customer experience can be significantly improved.
